### Building locally
Thanks to [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), building locally is easy no matter what platform you're on. Simply run the following command:

```text
./gradlew build
```

This build step will also run all checks and tests, making sure your code is clean.

JARs can be found in `build/libs/`.
